                    <p>I have a strong belief in "fairness".<br/>I believe that
                        everyone should be treated equally whether by
                        the private or public sector.</p>

            <p>With more and more services being delivered online, there is a significant
                section of the population who are being excluded. At the same time
                there is huge growth in low-cost devices capable
                of accessing those services (tablets and Smartphones).</p>
            <p>I am currently helping Trafford Libraries improve their digital inclusivity.</p>
            <p>In early 2014 I proposed a new service to help people make use of smartphones
                and tablet PCs. I set up the service, deliver it, and coordinate
                other volunteers. This has now expanded
                to cover a variety of topics all related to helping and motivating
                people to get the benefits that the internet offers.</p>
            <p>I am interested in expanding this work. I can offer non-profit organisations :
            <ul>
                <li>Advice sessions to clients on topics such as Introductions to
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smartphones or tablet PCs</li>
                        <li>Windows Desktops / Laptops</li>
                        <li>E-mail</li>
                        <li>Searching and using the web</li>
                        <li>Online safety</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
