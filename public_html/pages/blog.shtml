                        <p class="blog-post-meta">April 16, 2015 by <a href="#">Geoff Newell</a></p>

                        <p>This post is taken from an article I wrote for DEXodus
                            (the organisation for Digital Equipment Co. Alumni) in January 2013</p>
                        <p>
                            When I started working at Digital in 1985 I was writing PDP assembler code
                            (MACRO-11)  to implement IBM SNA communication protocol running over the public X.25 network.
                            Prior to that I had been working for various companies writing system level code (device drivers, bare metal programming etc.).
                            I say this to establish my “techie” credentials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my time at Digital and after, I moved further and further away from the process of making computers “do stuff” to showing the benefits of the “stuff” that they could do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A while ago it struck me that although I was surrounded by computers I no longer had any clue as to how to make them “do stuff”.
                            I had no idea where to start if I wanted to write a simple “hello world” program on my PC (or my smartphone or any of the other computers found around the house and elsewhere).
                            I found this rather disconcerting. Both I and the world had moved-on, but we’d gone in different directions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had enjoyed programming.
                            I enjoyed the thought processes involved and the sense of achievement when (for example) a freshly written piece of code actually displayed a number of radar plots on a graphics screen;
                            so to try to bring me up to date with how things are done today I took (and am taking) a number of OU courses on Linux, Java and Web technologies.
                        </p>
                        <h3>There is such a thing as a free lunch</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Linux course took students through from “What is free Software?” to writing shell scripts, installing and modifying Linux systems.
                            While this sounds daunting it was actually pretty straightforward and showed that <em>the underlying principles are pretty much unchanged.</em> 
                            The boot sequence today with BIOS, operating system loaders, miniloaders etc. is just as arcane as toggling keys on a PDP-8 to load a paper tape bootstrap.
                            The eye-opener for me on this course was how much free,
                            good quality software there is out there, and how mature the free software market is.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>Think “fee speech” rather than “free beer”</blockquote>
                        <p>
                            The recent announcement of a supported Ubuntu (a Linux flavour) release on smartphones shows one of the possibilities for mobile computing, and don’t forget that Android is also a flavour of Linux.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Java</h3>
                        <p>
                            There’s good and not so good things about Java (a discussion for another time), but the Object Oriented programming methods taught on the course were interesting.
                            What price Data Flow Diagrams now ?
                            All the stuff I used to know came back to me and is mostly helpful. 
                            <em>It seems to me that programming hasn’t got any easier or harder.</em>
                            There are more complex structures and data types to remember, but there is a huge library of code available for re-use so that a lot of the heavy lifting has already been done.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Money for nothing</h3>
                        <p>
                            One significant advance has been in the use of IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
                            Code is written using an editor that understands the language you are trying to write and which can fill bits in and correct what you’ve done.
                            Code is automatically compiled and run as required.
                            Documentation can even be produced semi-automatically.
                            All of this within an environment which is provided for free (think “free beer” this time).
                            I shudder to think how much licences for DECset used to cost.
                        </P>
                        <h3>My contribution to free software</h3>
                        <p>
                            To show that my investment in training has not been wasted, here’s a Java “Hello World” program.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
class myfirstjavaprog
{  
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
           System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
}
                        </code></pre>
                        All you need now is the latest Java Software Development Kit (JDK) which is free from Oracle, and you too can recapture your youth.
