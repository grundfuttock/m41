                        This post discusses Android launchers in general and reviews some of the most appropriate. There are no recommendations on the "best" launcher as personal preference and requirements differ from person to person.
                        <h1 class="section-heading">Introduction</h1>
                        <p>When asked by Age UK (Trafford) for some advice on purchasing
                            tablet PCs to help their clients get online it struck me how much
                            of their own "stuff" manufacturers / suppliers add to vanilla Android.
                            This "stuff" is intended to improve the customer experience,
                            but actually makes it more complicated to use. At this point
                            I started looking into Android Launchers in a bit more detail
                            to see if / how they could help simplify the user experience on Android Tablets.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="section-heading">What is a "Launcher"?</h1>
                        <img src="..\img\blogs\homescreen-stock.png" alt="screenshot - android homescreen" width="200" height="300" align="left" />
                        <p>Android is the underlying operating system for the majority of the world's tablets and smartphones.
                            Compared to Apple's iOS which powers iPad and iPhone, Android is remarkably configurable.
                            This is both a strength and a weakness. If you have an Apple device it is arguably easier to use "out of the box"
                            but there's not much you can do to change how it looks and operates.
                            Android devices, on the other hand, can be changed to look and operate completely differently.
                            Without any fancy stuff, you can configure your home screen to run a "Widget"
                            which can display the current time and weather. You may have another which
                            displays the news headlines and maybe a third which displays your appointments for the day.
                            At the bottom of the screen there will be a row of icons to select frequently used apps
                            and a button to give access to a list of all apps on your device (the app "drawer").
                            Icons and widgets can be moved around and additional home screens can be created.
                            In this way Android devices can be personalised much more than iOS devices.
                        </p>
                        <img src="..\img\blogs\homescreen-sl2a.png" alt="screenshot - android homescreen with alternative launcher" width="200" height="300" align="right" />
                        <strong>The next step in personalising Android devices is to change the Launcher. </strong>
                        <p>In simple terms, the Android Launcher is the bit of software that provides the user interface.
                            When the device is switched on, the Launcher provides your home screen(s).
                            It is the Launcher that determines which program to run when you select a particular icon on the home screen.
                            It is the Launcher that provides menus and organises how those menus are displayed.
                            The Launcher also determines how the applications installed on your device are shown.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="section-heading">How to change a Launcher</h1>
                        <p>
                            In simple terms, the Launcher is just another Android application (app).
                            Like other apps, Launchers are available through the Google Play store and can be
                            downloaded and installed in exactly the same way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Launcher will be run when the user presses the Android "home" button.
                            Like any other app, when Android has a choice of which app to run (e.g. Which app to run to play music)
                            it will pop-up a window asking which launcher you want to run when the "home" button is pressed.
                            One choice will be the existing launcher, the other choice(s) will be launchers you have downloaded
                            and installed.
                        </p>
                        <p>You will also have the choice of making this decision the default
                            or whether this choice is just for this time. If you choose the latter, each time
                            the user presses the "home" button they will be given the choice of which launcher to run.
                            Choosing the latter makes the newly installed launcher the default.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is relatively simple to remove a launcher so making a "permanent" change is not too scary.
                            The process can vary slightly from manufacturer to manufacturer and between versions of Android,
                            but the overall process is the same - clear the default for the "home" application and choose a new one.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select "applications" from within the Settings</li>
                            <li>Find the launcher you have installed and clear the defaults</li>
                            <li>Tap the "home" button and you should be presented with a list of options just as when you were installing the launcher.</li>
                            <li>Select your choice and "Always" and you're done.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h1 class="section-heading">Third Party Launchers</h1>
                        <p>
                            There are a huge number of third party launchers available through the Google Play store.
                            Most Launchers are free although many have a free version and a premium version which offers more functionality.
                            Most launchers are targeted at those who like to play with their phone / tablet
                            and so allow a large number of customisations (like customising a car) such as
                            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzpia.aqua.launcher">Buzz</a>,
                            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adw.launcher">ADW</a>,
                            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher">Nova</a>
                            and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anddoes.launcher">Apex</a>.
                            Others are aimed at performance for those who want to get their device to run as quickly as possible,
                            such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zeam">Zeam</a> (no longer maintained).
                            The third category of launcher is aimed at those who want their phone or tablet to be as easy to use as possible.
                            It is this category of launcher we are interested in for this article.

                        <p>
                            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.necta.launcher">Necta</a>
                            is produced by one of the main contributors to the XDA forums (one of the main forums for Android
                            technical discussions). It provides a good consistent interface with the usual big buttons / icons
                            and a high contrast background. It has some built-in apps which means that users do not just get launched
                            into the standard Android apps for camera / gallery, SMS, Contacts etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Necta also has "carer" type functionality such as sending SMS message to certain contacts if an alarm
                            is not cancelled within a certain period or a "find me" function which can send the user's current
                            location to a specific contact (as well as showing where you are on a map.
                            Necta also has quite a lot of other medical related functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The launcher is specifically targeted at Android phones and is not compatible with some or all tablet devices.
                            The launcher is free for a trial period of three days and then costs £4.60.
                        </p>

                            is also aimed at smartphone users rather than tablets.
                            There is a companion app (called "companion") that allows a relative or friend to provide
                            support from a remote location directly to the phone on which Wiser is running. Wiser is free.
                        </p>

                            launcher is available on tablet PCs and smartphones.
                            In addition to the usual large icons it also has the ability to hide some apps and to password lock the setup.
                            There is a free version with limited customisation and functionality. The full version costs £8.00.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Aviate</h2>
                        <p>
                            Aviate is produced by Yahoo. It is not specifically targeted at new or uncertain users.
                            The concept behind aviate is that it understands context such as time of day or location.
                            It uses this context to determine how to display your apps. You can create groups of apps such as "home" or "work"
                            and Aviate will bring those apps to the fore when it detects you are at one of those locations.

                            Smart Launcher 2 is also not targeted at older users or children.
                            It aims to provide a simple easy to use interface.
                            It is specifically designed to provide a good user experience on both smartphones and tablets.
                            Applications are assigned categories. Each category is represented on the home screen.
                            In the App drawer, applications are displayed within categories. Applications may be hidden.
                            While the free version is fully featured and not limited, there is a "pro" version (Smart Launcher 3) priced at £2.97.

                        <p>Launchers seem to fall into one of two categories.
                            Some are aimed at those (maybe older) who may have some medical problems such as poor sight or poor flexibility
                            in their hands. Others are just aimed at making the use of a smartphone and/or tablet easier without
                            any specific features for those with infirmities.
                        </p>
                        <p>This table gives a list of features that should be considered when selecting a launcher.
                            Not every box needs to be ticked, for example if you are looking for a launcher for a smartphone
                            it doesn't matter that the launcher does not run on a tablet.</p>
