                    <h1>Why</h1>
                    <p>I have over forty years experience in the IT industry, from system level device-drivers to enterprise sales
                        through consultancy, project and line management</p>
                </div>

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>Following my degree in Computation at Manchester university, I have been working in IT since 1976. From writing industrial control systems in assembler
                through project management to sales and team management. For more details, a <a href="pages/downloads.shtml">copy of of my CV</a> is available to view or download.</p>
            <p>In 2005 I left IT and ran my own (non-IT related) business.</p>
            <p>More recently I have rediscovered the joy in developing solutions that are elegant, simple and effective.</p>
            <p>As an aside, a comparison of programming in the 1970s to the current day shows that, while complexity has increased significantly,
                the toolset available has improved immeasurably.</p>
            <p> Another significant change is in the number of people employed in development and a new culture
                of openness. Although this has changed the pioneering nature of programming to one of building from existing components,
                the underlying joy of blending order with creativity remains.</p>
            <p>Since 2013 I have been complementing my IT skills with volunteer work for Trafford council, providing advice
            on Digital Inclusion and delivering introductory IT sessions to Trafford residents.</p>
